#### Dependencies:

* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is required (tested with version 1.4.0)

* numpy is required

* [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/) is optional (tested with Kinetic on Ubuntu 16.04)

* [ford_msgs](https://bitbucket.org/acl-swarm/ford_msgs/src/master/) if you're using ROS, for our custom msg definitions.
